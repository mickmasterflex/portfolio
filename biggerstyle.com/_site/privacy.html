    <div class="content-area">
        <p><strong>USE OF THIS WEBSITE SIGNIFIES YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT TO COMPLY WITH THE ENTIRE PRIVACY POLICY.</strong></p>
        <p>This privacy policy (<strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>) is designed to inform you about the types of information that BiggerStyle.com (hereinafter <strong>"Company"</strong>) collects from you in connection with your use of BiggerStyle.com (the <strong>"Website"</strong>). It is also intended to explain the conditions under which Company uses and discloses that information and your rights relating to the collection, use and disclosure of that information. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the terms <strong>"we,"</strong> <strong>"us,"</strong> and <strong>"our"</strong> refer to Company, and <strong>"you"</strong> or <strong>"your"</strong> refers to you, as a user of this Website.</p>
        <p>Note to All Users</p>
        <p><strong>Your Consent.</strong> By using the Website, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. Please review the entire policy to learn about what information is gathered, how such information us used, and what information may be disclosed to third parties.</p>

        <h4>Note to California Residents</h4>
        <p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights.</strong> California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have provided personal information (as defined by statute) to us or our third party advertisers and marketing partners, if any, to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes.

        <h4>Personally-Identifying Information We Collect</h4>
        <p>Personally-identifying information is collected when you voluntarily provide such information to Company (<strong>“Personal Information”</strong>). Personal Information we collect may include one or more of the following categories: educational, employment or employer. Educational Personal Information collected may include, but is not limited to, your first and last name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail address, year you graduated high school, age, educational history, military affiliation, and program of interest.

Employer Personal Information collected may include, but is not limited to, your first and last name, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address.</p>
        <p>Company may also get Personal Information from third party vendors with whom we contract to advertise on behalf of Company and our clients (<strong>“Affiliate”</strong>) when you voluntarily provide such information to an Affiliate and request information about one of Company’s clients or otherwise request our services. Company may also get data from our customers and other third parties that help us understand online activity and improve efficiency. For example, a customer may tell us how you responded to an ad, whether you enroll in an educational program or are hired to measure the effectiveness of and improve the quality of our services. If you communicate to us by e-mail, we will record the e-mail address from which you send your message. Any telephone calls to and from Company may be monitored and recorded for quality assurance and training purposes.</p>
        
        <h4>Non-Personally-Identifying Information We Collect</h4>
        <p>Non-personally identifying information or <strong>“Aggregate Information”</strong> is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person. Like most website operators, we collect Aggregate Information about your activities online including referring / exit pages and URLs, computer settings, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information through the use of the methods described below. If you have voluntarily disclosed Personal Information to Company, some or all of the Aggregate Information may be linked to your Personal Information.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies.</strong> A cookie is small data file stored on the your hard drive that your browser provides to the Website when you visit certain web pages. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, the data is temporarily stored on the your computer, but once you close the browser the cookie terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the your hard drive for an extended period of time. This allows us to track our your visit and help improve our website’s functionality, navigation and performance. If you do not want to store cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, some parts of the Website may not function properly if you choose not to accept cookies. If you are concerned that you have created a cookie in a previous visit, you can delete cookies that are already stored on your hard drive by accessing your computer’s cookie file.</p>
        <p><strong>Pixel Tags.</strong> Company and our third party advertising partners use pixel tags. Pixel tags (a.k.a. clear gifs or web beacons) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that allow us to monitor the use of the Website and to deliver banner advertisements to you about our products and services as you browse the Internet. Pixel tags generally work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. You cannot decline pixel tags; however, if you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit. In addition, we use pixel tags in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by the recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you do not want to receive these pixel tags you can opt-out of these emails or change the type of e-mail you receive to text only.</p>
        <p><strong>Internet Protocol Address.</strong> Company’s servers also automatically identify your computer by its Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider. Your IP address does not identify you by name; however, it may reveal your geographic area and your Internet service provider.</p>
        <p><strong>Computer Profiles.</strong> Company may also collect and accumulate computer profile data which will help us understand and analyze the Internet experience of our visitors. For example, Company may collect data relating to the type of browser used, operating system software, screen resolution, color capability, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords and JavaScript enablement.</p>
        <p><strong>Click-Through URLS.</strong> Company may send you e-mail messages with a <strong>“click-through URL”</strong> linked to the content of the Website. When you click onto one of these URLs, you will pass through our server before arriving at the destination webpage. Company may track this click-through data to help us determine subscriber interest in the subject matter and measure the effectiveness of our subscriber communications. You can avoid being tracked simply by not clicking on any links or images in the e-mail.</p>
        <p><strong>Domain Name Tracking.</strong> When you visit the Website, we automatically record the name of the domain name and URL from which you accessed the Website. Additionally, if you got to the Website by means of a link from another site, our computers will note the fact that you came to us from that linked site. We may also record the domain name and URL for the next website you go to after leaving the Website.</p>
        
        <h4>Use of Information Collected</h4>
        <p>Our primary purpose for collecting Personal Information and Aggregate Information (collectively <strong>“User Information”</strong>) is to provide you with the services you request.

You may also be contacted by Company, one of our Service Providers or other third party regarding employment opportunities or alternative offers from other schools.</p>
        <p><strong>E-mail and Text Opt-out.</strong> If you no longer wish to receive our promotional e-mail communications, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the Unsubscribe link at the bottom of the marketing emails or by emailing us at unsubscribe@BiggerStyle.com.
