# Portfolio
This is the work portfolio of Mickey Schwarz, front-end/full-stack developer.

## BiggerStyle & TouchpointSolar
Both biggerstyle.com and touchpointsolar.com projects show the breadth of my front-end developing skillset with almost the entire projects (around 90-95%) being coded out by myself. Site designs were created by in-house graphic designer while implementation and key site functionality (javascript) design decisions made by myself.

## Jekyll & Prometheus
Jekyll and Prometheus were both projects that I contributed in more of a full-stack developer role. Prometheus was a project that connected with a proprietary API that my former company had developed and interpreted results in a easy to consume way on the front-end.
